# Fast-MEEMD
A new data-driven based architecture (fast-MEEMD) to decompose spatial-temporal data into multi components and a residue
In EEMD, a time series of climate variable (e.g. SCF in this paper) at individual grid or pixel is decomposed into few Intrinsic Mode functions (IMF) C_j  (j=1,2…n) and a residue R_n, a curve either monotonic or containing only one extremum, from which no additional oscillatory components can be extracted:
For multidimensional spatial-temporal data, one can piece together the similar timescale components of data series from all pixels to form a temporal evolution of spatially coherent structure of that time scale. This is the essence of MEEMD.
To study a larger region as a whole with better acceleration, we propose a new version of fast-MEEMD here. Briefly speaking, it’s a method combine EEMD with dimension reduction algorithm and transfer learning. 
further information will be avialable after paper publish.
